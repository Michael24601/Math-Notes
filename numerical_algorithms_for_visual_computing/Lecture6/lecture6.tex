\subsection*{Rotation Around Axis}

First note that if a matrix has the property:
\[ A^T = A \]
then it is symmetric (top right triangle
is equal to bottom left). \\
And if we have:
\[ A^T = -A \]
then it is skew symmetric (top right triangle
is the negation of the bottom left). \\

Suppose we want to generate the rotation
matrix in $\R^3$ for a rotation around some
axis $a$ (given by a vector with length $1$). \\

We can imagine that the vector we want to rotate,
$u$, and the axis around which we want
to rotate, $a$,
form a triangle.
We can then define an ODE for the trajectory
in terms of the angle or time parameter:
\[ \dfrac{du}{d\theta} = a \times u \]
Which we can do by looking at the image
and doing some trigonometry on the triangle. \\
We can also express the cross product as a matrix:
\[ \dfrac{du}{d\theta} = 
\matThree{0}{-a_z}{a_y}{a_z}{0}{-a_x}{-a_y}{a_x}{0}
u \]
We can all the matrix $[a]_\times$
We already know how to solve this using the
Maclaurin series of the exponential 
$e^{[a]_\times\theta}u(0)$,
where $u(0)$ is the initial condition. \\

Now note that $([a]_\times)^3 = -[a]_\times$,
which means that $([a]_\times)^6 = [a]_\times$,
which means that the matrix is cyclic. \\
Using that to our advantage,
we can reduce the Maclaurin series to
a formula with $\sin$ and $\cos$:
\[ e^{G\theta} = \sum_k^{\infty} 
\dfrac{(G\theta)^k}{k!}
= I + \sin(\theta)[a]_\times 
+ (1-\cos(\theta))([a]_\times)^2 \]
So this is the rotation matrix
that multiplies (and rotates) $u$
around the axis $a$. \\

If $\|u\| \neq 1$, then the length
could just be factored out,
and the formula would be more or less
the same. \\ 

Now we've defined the exponentional,
and as we know, the logarithm is the inverse
operation: takes as input:
\[ I + \sin(\theta)[a]_\times 
+ (1-\cos(\theta))([a]_\times)^2 \]
And should return $[a]_\times\theta$. \\

So how to write an explicit logarithm?
Last time, with a normal rotation matrix,
it was easy to extract $J\theta$,
since $J$ was always the same. \\

In this case, we would need to first do:
\[ \dfrac{R - R^T}{2} = \sin(\theta)[a]_\times \]

We can then do more (divide by $\sin$)
to access the matrix. \\

We can also interpolate in the same way. \\
Note that we don't just interpolate around
the angle, we have to use the interpolation
formula, since the two rotations we are
interpolating between may be around different
axis. \\

Interpolation gives the fastest path
between two rotations. \\

The logarithm maps to the Lie Algebra from the
Group.

\subsection*{Lie Algebra of the Special
Orthogonal Group}

As we know, the general linear group:
\[ GL_n(\F) \]
is the group made up of invertible
matrices in $\R^{n \times n}$. \\

Formula about Lie Algebra of $SO(n)$.

Note on eigendecomposition and how it helps
take exponent to find Lie Algebra. \\

Note on the Lie Algebra $so(n)$,
and what it is. \\

Note on interpolation in $O(n)$,
and how it only works if the two
transformations $R$ have the same determinant
sign (no reflection between the two),
can't go smoothly \\
Logarithm of matrix won't work for
a negative determinant. \\

\newpage

\subsection*{Quaternions}

Quaternions are like complex numbers:
\[ q = q_0 + iq_1 + jq_2 + kq_3 \]
Where $i$, $j$ and $k$ are imaginary.

We have anti-sommutativity:
\[ ij = -ji \]
Meaning flipping the order flips the sign. \\

We also defined the quaternion inverse which
is the same as the complex number inverse.

We then use the taylor series on:
\[ e^{\theta(u_xi + u_yj + u_zk)} \]
To get a 3D rotation.

We also do interpolation.
