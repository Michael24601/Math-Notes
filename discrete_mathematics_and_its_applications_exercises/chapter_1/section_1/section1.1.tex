    \section*{Exercise 1}
    A proposition has to be true or false,
    so that means:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*.}]
        \item
            \enquote{Boston is the capital of Massachusetts} 
            is a proposition (true).
        \item
            \enquote{Miami is the capital of Florida} 
            is a proposition (false).
        \item 
            $2 + 3 = 5$ is a proposition (true).
        \item 
            $5 + 7 = 10$ is a proposition (false).
        \item 
            $x + 2 = 11$ is not a proposition 
            (can be true or false depending on $x$).
        \item
            \enquote{Answer this question} 
            doesn't even make a claim,
            so not a proposition.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*.}]
        \item
            Linda is older or has the same age as Sanjay.
        \item
            Mei makes less or as much money as Isabella. 
        \item 
            Moshe is shorter or has the same height as Monica.
        \item 
            Abby is poorer or just as rich as Ricardo.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section*{Exercise 10}
    We have 
    \[ p \text{: I bought a lottery ticket this week.} \]
    \[ q \text{: I won the million dollar jackpot.} \]
    So
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*.}]
        \item
            $\neg p$: I did not buy a lottery ticket this week.
        \item
            $p \lor q$: I bought a lottery ticket this week
            or won the million dollar jackpot.
        \item 
            $p \implies q$: If I bought a lottery ticket this week,
            then I won the million dollar jackpot.
        \item 
            $p \land q$: I bought a lottery ticket this week
            and I won the million dollar jackpot.
        \item
            $p \iff q$: I bought a lottery ticket this week if and only if
            I won the million dollar jackpot.
        \item
            $\neg p \implies \neg q$:
            If I did not buy a lottery ticket this week,
            then I did not win the million dollar jackpot.
        \item
            $\neg p \land \neg q$:
            I did not buy a lottery ticket this week
            and I did not win the million dollar jackpot.
        \item 
            $\neg p \lor (p \land q)$:
            I did not buy a lottery ticket this week
            or I bought a lottery ticket this week
            and I wont the million dollar jackpot.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section*{Exercise 13}
    We have 
    \[ p \text{: It is below freezing.} \]
    \[ q \text{: It is snowing.} \]
    So
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\alph*.}]
        \item
            It is below freezing and snowing:
            $p \land q$.
        \item
            It is below freezing but not snowing:
            $p \land \neg q$.
        \item 
            It is not below freezing and it is not snowing:
            $\neg p \land \neg q$.
        \item 
            It is either snowing or below freezing (or both):
            $p \lor q$.
        \item
            If it is below freezing, it is also snowing:
            $p \implies q$.
        \item
            Either it is below freezing or it is snowing, but it is
            not snowing if it is below freezing:
            $(p \lor q) \land (p \implies \neg q)$.
        \item
            That it is below freezing is necessary and sufficient
            for it to be snowing:
            $p \iff q$.
    \end{enumerate}
